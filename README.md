### Descriptive Statistics:

Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the characteristics of a dataset.

#### Sample and Population Data:

- **Sample Data:** Data collected from a subset of a population.
- **Population Data:** Data that represents the entire group being studied.

#### Types of Data:

- **Categorical Data:** Data that represents categories or groups.
  - **Nominal:** Data with categories that have no inherent order.
  - **Ordinal:** Data with categories that have a defined order or ranking.
- **Numerical Data:** Data that represents quantities or measurements.
  - **Discrete:** Data with distinct and separate values.
  - **Continuous:** Data with an infinite number of possible values within a range.

#### Levels of Measurement:

- **Qualitative Data:** Data that describes qualities or characteristics.
  - **Nominal:** Data that consists of categories with no inherent order.
  - **Ordinal:** Data that consists of categories with a defined order or ranking.
- **Quantitative Data:** Data that represents quantities or measurements.
  - **Interval:** Data where the intervals between consecutive values are equal, but there is no true zero point.
  - **Ratio:** Data where the intervals between consecutive values are equal, and there is a true zero point.

#### Measures of Central Tendency:

- **Mean:** The average value of a dataset.
- **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
- **Median:** The middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest.
- **Skewness:** A measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset.

#### Measures of Dispersion:

- **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.
- **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the Mean.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).
- **Percentiles:** The values that divide a dataset into 100 equal parts.
- **Quantiles:** The values that divide a dataset into equal parts.



### Inferential Statistics:

Inferential statistics involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on data collected from a sample.

#### Random Variables:

- **Continuous:** Variables that can take any value within a given range, often measured.
- **Discrete:** Variables that can only take specific, distinct values, usually counted.

#### Probability Distributions:

- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** Describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value.
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** Describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** Gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

#### Types of Distributions:

- **Normal Distribution:** Bell-shaped curve characterized by its mean and standard deviation.
- **Standard Normal Distribution:** A special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Studentâ€™s t Distribution:** Used for hypothesis testing when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown.
- **Log-normal Distribution:** Distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.
- **Power-law Distribution:** Describes a relationship between two quantities, where one quantity varies as a power of another.
- **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Bernoulli Distribution:** Describes the outcome of a single binary experiment.
- **Poisson Distribution:** Describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Exponential Distribution:** Describes the time until the next event in a Poisson process.
- **Uniform Distribution:** All outcomes are equally likely.

#### Estimators and Estimates:

- **Point Estimates:** Single value estimates for population parameters based on sample data.
- **Confidence Interval:** Range of values within which the true parameter is estimated to lie with a certain level of confidence.
- **Z-score:** Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
- **Margin of Error:** Measures the accuracy of the estimate based on the sample size and variability.

#### Hypothesis Testing:

- **Null Hypothesis:** A statement that there is no effect or no difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests there is an effect or difference.
- **One-Way and Two-Way Hypothesis Test:** Tests that involve one or two variables, respectively.
- **P-value:** The probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
- **Alpha:** The level of significance, representing the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Errors:** Errors in hypothesis testing where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected or incorrectly accepted, respectively.
- **Z-test:** A statistical test used to determine if the means of two populations are different when the sample size is large and/or the population variance is known.
- **Chi-square test:** A test used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** The number of independent values or quantities which can be assigned to a statistical distribution.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** A statistical technique used to compare means of more than two groups.
- **F-test:** A statistical test used to compare the variances of two populations.
- **T-test:** A statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.
